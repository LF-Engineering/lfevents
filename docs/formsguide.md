# LFEvents Forms Guide

LFEvents runs many forms and most of them submit to the HubSpot platform.  The default implementation of HubSpot forms, using an embedded iframe, significantly slows down the performance of the site, reducing the [homepage](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/) performance score from in the 90s to about 60 as measured by Google's https://web.dev/measure/.  This poor performance is a [known issue](https://community.hubspot.com/t5/Sales-Integrations/Wordpress-Plugin-Reduces-Site-Performance/td-p/244897).

We have gone to great lengths to write the LFEvents site to be [as fast as possible](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/2019/11/14/new-website-performance/) and would not want that effort to have gone to waste just because we are now migrating forms to the HubSpot platform.  So to reduce the impact of the HubSpot form integration, we have delayed the load of the HubSpot js files using [Flying Scripts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flying-scripts/).  To the user, the page now appears to load as fast as before, and the HubSpot js files load later.  We do this on all pages except for the few pages with [forms above-the-fold](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/contact/), in which a longer delay for loading the form would not be appropriate.
