### Create content while your page is live.

You can use the Lockdown condition to create draft blocks. Once your blocks are ready to be published you can remove the condition. Safely work on your published WordPress content over multiple days by hiding the blocks that aren't yet finished. Just make them visible on when you are ready. 

### Restrict block content

Restrict any WordPress Block by simply clicking on it inside the WordPress Block Editor. You can open the Condition Builder and add visibility rules to the selected block. You'll be able to set it to appear for logged in or out users only.

Great for creating content that's visible to members only on your site.

### Control Mobile Blocks

You can select specific screen sizes to display your blocks on, and exclude them from others! Pick and choose if the block should be shown on mobile, tablet or desktop. The block content will automatically be displayed or hidden for each different screen sizes.
