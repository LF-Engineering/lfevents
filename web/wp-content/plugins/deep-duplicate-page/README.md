# Deep Duplicate Page

WordPress plugin that adds a "Deep Duplicate" action to the page row actions.  A deep duplicate of a page duplicates the page and all children creating a new copy of the full page tree.

This plugin used the page duplication script [here](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-duplicate-wordpress-page-post) as a starting point but then adds recursion over page children to duplicate the full tree.
