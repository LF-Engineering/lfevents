# Clone Page Tree

WordPress plugin that adds a "Clone Page Tree" action to the page row actions.  Cloning a page tree clones the page and all children creating a new copy of the full hierarchy.

This plugin used the page duplication script [here](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-clone-wordpress-page-post) as a starting point but then adds recursion over page children to clone the full tree.
